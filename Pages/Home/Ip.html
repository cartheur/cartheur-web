            <p align="justify">Beginning in 1997, I created the first prototypes of a new kind of technology, wireless power transfer. While it had been done in the early 20th Century, particularly in the Weimar Republic, I examined the problem in the light of new technological paradigms, such as semiconductors and paramagnetic materials. This led to a series of oscillators that demonstrate four distinct kinds of wireless power transfer. Those most useful to solve present-day problems we research and manufacture:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Near or mid-range projection</li>
                <li>Encompassed e-mobility</li>

            <p align="justify">The subject of wireless power has been of great fascination since antiquity. First proposed in modern times by Nikola Tesla, it has intrigued and challenged the entire world. While there have been many attempts to describe this work, the mathematical explanation of wireless power can be traced to J. Clerk Maxwell's original equations and the behaviour of wireless power in the circuit is due to Joseph Larmor's fundamental works on the dynamics of the field concept. This book deals with the theory, as well as experiments one can perform by building those described within its pages. The idea is that anyone can grasp an understanding of wireless power and how to use it in their daily lives with a minimum of technical effort.</p>

<h4>Conversational interative software</h4>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p align="justify">In 2006, I began thinking about interactive software. Then I started to become obsessed with understanding what a runtime was. I mean, you have the software which fills a robot, written by thousands of people, then you turn it on and interact with it. Now it is running. That, what is that in terms of the state of the software? Where are the feedback routines? One day a colleague said what I was describing was something out of dystopian science fiction. But I know better. How many robots fail when this concept is not addressed in software? All. Here is the insurance that they will never be able to overtake humanity. With that out of the way, what is personality, warmth, and emotion? Why do we need it so badly? I cannot say that I know, but I do know how it might look. I can't tell you the trick, but take some time to interact with one of our companions and see what I mean.</p>
