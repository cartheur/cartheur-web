                <b>Neuronal energy transfer device</b>
            </p>
            <p align="justify">A device for transferring electrical energy to neuronal tissues via well-understood concepts of physics, specifically the body of theory contained in transmission of energy by magnetic resonance. This is a compact device which serves to provide a localized application of electric circuital currents to electrically-engaged tissues, designed to operate at the characteristic frequency of the user. In principle, it bears similarities to other magnetic-resonant technologies, such as the MRI, but has been developed specifically to transfer energy compatible to the human body at a range from 300kHz to 2 MHz.</p>
            <p align="justify">In ordinary usage, the device transfers energy via an external metallic disc which is placed at a point the skin where its effects are desired to be transferred to tissues limited by the projection of the field, typically three to five centimeters. The charges act in a similar way to those seen in systems exhibiting eddy currents contained in Bloch waves in lattices. By the introduction of frequencies subcutaneously using acoustic transposition when the electrical currents at their given frequency and geometry, propagate a wavelet through the conductive as well as the fluidal tissues. Theoretical observable effects are stimulation of the connections between neurons and growth of dendrites in the axions of neuronal tissues. Some physical experimentation has been performed which lends credence to the theory put forth. Other sources in the literature note: With an exposure of 15 minutes, significant growth is observed, as documented in peer-reviewed publications. Regarding pure exposure of the generated field outside of the use of the metallic component, the magnetic field is < 50uT.</p>
            <p align="justify">
                The device will operate upon any neuronal tissues of the body, including the electrical tissues of the brain. With an exposure on the brain stem, growth and quality of the connections between neurons is increased and the computational ability of the brain is improved. It is speculated at this point in the research and development of the device that memory and the manifestation of intelligence is also improved, given exposure is yielded upon those correct parts of the brain where the improvement is desired. More testing and financial support is required to explore whether or not the technique aids in improving electrical performance in the body. In the scope of any powered-usage of the device, preferably by battery, the potential of the power emission is based upon the transformation (and compression ratio) of electrical energy to acoustic and hydrodynamics by the inductive draw of current by the neuronal cells and their genetic profile.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                The mathematical principle which forms the basis of what this device does to the human body has been written up in a paper which I have been sending to different neurological journals, currently without luck. But I am still purusing this. In the meantime, you can have a look at what the theory entails by downloading it from <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Synaptic_enhancement_of_cell_morphology_by_controlled_energetic_transfer_by_non-thermal_radio-frequency_waves_to_multipolar_neurons/7121558" target="_blank">figshare</a>.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                For fun and interest, I entered into a competition called <i>Create the future </i> and here is our <a href="https://contest.techbriefs.com/2018/entries/medical/9077" target="_blank">2018</a> entry. Please <a href="https://contest.techbriefs.com/how-to-vote" target="_blank">vote</a> if you like it and in the near future want one. The biotech device needs a bit of discussion as this is a very important, if altogether ignored aspect of how wireless power can directly improve the lives of disabled or persons with battery-powered implants.
